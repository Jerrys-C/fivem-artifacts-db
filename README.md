# FiveM Artifacts DB

A simple website that keeps a **log of FiveM artifacts with known issues**; and provides a download link to the most recent artifacts if no issues have been reported with it.

## Contributing

Make a PR to update `db.json` in the root of this repository, with the artifact number and an explanation of what is wrong with it. We will review it ASAP and merge your contribution which will automatically update the site.

If you want to make an improvement to the site itself, feel free to submit a PR with that too :)
